        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>“Hi! I’m Andreea. I’m a UX/UI designer with a background in graphic design and psychology. I’m passionate about improving the ways in which we interact with technology by creating simple and intuitive designs.“</p>
        <p>"Creating beautiful, high-quality artworks has been a big part of my recent job. As a hard-working self-starter I am looking to use my visual communication knowledge to wireframe, prototype and design engaging user interfaces for products
          that are accessible and beneficial to the user.
          I’m ready to make a difference in an innovative team that aims to bring value into people’s lives and to implement new ideas quickly and successfully, helping to simplify work processes."</p>
        <p>"A passion for delivering the best experience has led me to teach myself new skills to create unique solutions and content that exceeds expectations. I have gained a variety of knowledge throughout my professional career, and with frontend
          development and interface skills, I'm capable of tasks beyond the role of a Designer and will be able to communicate effectively within a tech team to create digital products that are easily understood and more enjoyable to use. Take a look
          at my portfolio: behance.net/andreeacatana and get in touch!"</p>
        <p>"With almost ten-years experience in an interdisciplinary setting coupled with social science education I am certain I can use my diverse skill set to face with great success diverse challenges, to deliver in time and in quality, whilst
          taking into consideration the company needs."</p>
        <p>"I’m currently available for both freelance and contract work in the Hamburg area or remotely."</p>
